## Message

Hello Igor Savin, good morning.
My name is Flavio and I am developing a [Î»ORM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lambdaorm) for NodeJs in TypeScript.
It would be of great help to me if you could give me your opinion on the project. And you could also exchange ideas about ORM.

One of the notable features is the [Include](https://github.com/lambda-orm/lambdaorm/wiki/Include) allows obtaining data on the relationships of an entity in a single query. These data may be in different databases.

From already thank you very much
