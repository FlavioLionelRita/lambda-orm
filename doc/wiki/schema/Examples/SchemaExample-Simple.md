The schema defines how the entities of the model are mapped with the database tables.

![schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlavioLionelRita/lambdaorm/HEAD/images/schema.svg)

```yaml
domain:
  entities:
    - name: Countries
      primaryKey: ["iso3"]
      uniqueKey: ["name"]
      properties:
        - name: name
          required: true
        - name: iso3
          length: 3
          required: true
      relations:
        - name: states
          type: manyToOne
          composite: true
