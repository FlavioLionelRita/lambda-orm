# Contributing to LambdaORM

We love your contribution! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it is:

- Report a bug
- Discuss the current status of the code.
- Submit a solution
- Propose new features.
- Become a maintainer

## We develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as to accept pull requests.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes are made via pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you have added code that needs to be tested, add tests.
3. If you have changed the APIs, update the documentation.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License.

In short, when you submit code changes, it is understood that your submissions are under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that concerns you.

## Report bugs using Github [issues](https://github.com/FlavioLionelRita/lambdaorm/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; It is easy!

## Write bug reports with details, background and sample code

**Excellent bug reports** tend to have:

- A brief summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give a sample code if you can.
- What you expected to happen
- What's really happening?
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening or things you tried that didn't work)

## License
